I wrote this little AddIn because I have blocks of code that I use fairly often such as the error handling code. To save me having to type this all the time I wrote this AddIn. I think that this whole AddIn is about as simple as an addin can get and as such is maybe the best learning example for a VB IDE AddIn. I have also added some comments to help you understand how I determined certain properties for my own items.

I have in this version found the answer to the problem I had in the previous version, namely how to use a text file to maintain the list of Menu Items. Basically I have placed everything for a Menu Item into a Class Module I can then create one instance of this class for each menu item as I read it from the file.

Now I do not know much about Object Orientated Programming but from my understanding this is essentially what OO is all about. By definition an Object has Properties and Methods, both of which my class has. I can now treat each Menu Item as an objet and create as many as I like.
